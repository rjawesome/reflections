Q:What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it? When you initialize a repository a set of files(could be 1) will go into git and a .git file will be created. Note that no commits will be created when you initialize a repository.
Q:How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers? The staging area offers a in-between for commits and working directory.
Q:How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change? You can use git diff --staged to see if the change from staging area to repository is a logical change.
